# Relational-Database-Development-Project

This project entails the creation of a relational database for a chosen local organization to address specific operational issues or improve existing processes. Following a structured approach, the task involves researching the organization's operations, designing an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), normalizing the database to at least Third Normal Form (3NF), implementing the database in Microsoft SQL Serverâ„¢ environment using Transact SQL (T-SQL) scripts, and creating queries, views, stored procedures, triggers, and other necessary objects. Additional marks are awarded for adherence to coding standards, comments, naming conventions, exception handling, readability, and code efficiency. The submission requires three files: a document detailing organization background, ERD, normalization steps, object descriptions, queries, and queries; a T-SQL script for database creation; and a full SQL Server database backup.
